# Stem_and_Leaf_Design_Implementation_UKA

“A stem-and-leaf display or stem-and-leaf plot is a device for presenting quantitative data in a graphical
format, like a histogram, to assist in visualizing the shape of a distribution. They evolved from Arthur
Bowley's work in the early 1900s and are useful tools in exploratory data analysis. Stemplots became more
commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of John Tukey's book on exploratory data analysis in
1977. The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of monospaced (typewriter) typestyles
that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers'
superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.”

Building a program that:

a) Greets the user.
b) Asks the user to input a 1, 2 or 3.
c) Given the input, reads in the appropriate datafile and displays a stem-and-leaf plot.
a. Note: This will require you to make several design decisions. I am not looking for a
specific format, but the final format should be well thought out.
d) Loops until the user wishes to exit.
